class FlexibleCheckConditionState(EventState):
    """
    Implements a state that checks if the given condition is true.

    Uses multiple userdata inputs provided as a list to the calculation function and
    returns the corresponding outcome.

    This state can be used if the further control flow of the behavior depends on a simple condition.

    -- predicate    function    The condition whose truth value will be evaluated.
                                It could be a private function (self.foo) manually defined in a behavior's source code
                                or a lambda function (e.g., lambda x: x[0]**2 < 10 and x[1] == 'hello'),
                                where x is the list argument passed to the function.

    -- input_keys   string[]    List of available input keys.

    ># input_keys   object[]    Input(s) to the calculation function as a list of userdata.
                                The individual inputs can be accessed as list elements (see lambda expression example).

    <= true                     Returned if the condition evaluates to True
    <= false                    Returned if the condition evaluates to False
